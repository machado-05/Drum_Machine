# Drum Machine

A simple drum machine built with React, featuring interactive drum pads, a power button, volume control, and a display to show the name of the currently played sound. The application allows users to play sounds by clicking on the drum pads or pressing keyboard keys.

## Features

- **Power Button**: Turns the drum machine on and off.
- **Drum Pads**: Play different drum sounds when clicked or triggered by keyboard keys.
- **Volume Control**: Adjust the volume using a slider.
- **Display**: Shows the name of the currently played sound or a placeholder message when the "Bank" button is clicked.

## Usage

1. **Power Button**: Click the power button to turn the drum machine on or off. When off, the drum pads and controls are disabled.

2. **Drum Pads**: Click on any drum pad or press the corresponding keyboard key (Q, W, E, A, S, D, Z, X, C) to play the associated sound. The display will show the name of the drum pad for the duration of the sound.

3. **Volume Control**: Use the slider to adjust the volume of the drum sounds.
